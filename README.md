# Traffic Sign Classifier

### **REQUIREMENTS**

The program is written in python, and we require the Python version of OpenCV to be installed.

If it is not already installed, you must first make sure that Python is installed.

Then, simply run `pip install opencv-python` and you should be good to go.

### **TO RUN THE CODE...**

Open your terminal in the `\Traffic-Sign-Classifier\src` directory, and from there, run the following command:

`> python ./main.py`

Once you do this, the program should run with no issues.

A window with an image should appear, in which case the program has "finished". To close the program, just press any key while the window is focused.

It may take up to a minute before the window, so hang tight if it does not appear immediately.
